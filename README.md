# Flow Chess

Flow Chess is a website made to customize your chess experience. Change the number of rows and columns on the board, place pieces wher you want them, and have fun!

Let me know if you find any bugs!

## About

I was learning HTML and JavaScript, so I wanted a cool project to work on. I had the idea of a chess board that could be customizable for a long time (I didn't at the time know that it was made already), but I didn't know how to make it. As soon as I came to the realization that I could make this idea as a website, I immediately got started. The idea for the "Build A Piece" aspect, came later down the line while I was brainstorming on how to make the website more unique.

Like I explained earlier, I jumped into the project as I was (still am) learning HTML and JS. I learned a lot from this project and if I were to do it again, I would make it very different. I feel as if my code "*evolved*" as I progressed through the project. Overall, I am proud of this project and I hope you enjoy my creation!
